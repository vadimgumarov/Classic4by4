## 2. Detailed Website Enhancement Plan

### 2.1 Design System Implementation

#### Brand Implementation
We'll implement the official Retrokraft brand identity throughout the Wix site:
- Use Retrokraft logo in correct Navy Blue (#1D3E69) or white variations
- Apply the official brand color palette through Wix theme customization
- Implement Poppins and Roboto typography through Wix font manager
- Create premium whitespace through padding adjustments
- Configure UI components to reflect the Retrokraft aesthetic within Wix limitations

#### Color Palette Implementation
Implementing the official Retrokraft brand colors through Wix color settings:
- Primary Navy Blue: #1D3E69 (RGB: 29, 62, 105) - Main brand color
- Burnt Orange: #D95F02 (RGB: 217, 95, 2) - Accent color
- Light Pink: #FFC0CB (RGB: 255, 192, 203) - Soft accent color 
- Golden Yellow: #FFBB00 (RGB: 255, 187, 0) - Highlight color
- Peach Cream: #FFE2C6 (RGB: 255, 226, 198) - Background color
- White: #FFFFFF (RGB: 255, 255, 255) - For contrast and readability
- Black: #000000 (RGB: 0, 0, 0) - For text and details

Color application principles (adapted for Wix):
- Apply Navy Blue to headers, navigation, and footer backgrounds
- Use Burnt Orange for CTA buttons and important highlights
- Apply Light Pink and Golden Yellow sparingly as accent elements
- Implement Peach Cream for content section backgrounds
- Use white for text on dark backgrounds and clean UI elements
- Apply black for primary text on light backgrounds

#### Typography Implementation
Implementing the Retrokraft typography through Wix font settings:
- Add Google Fonts to Wix: Poppins and Roboto
- Create consistent text styles in Wix editor:
  - Headings: Poppins (various weights)
  - Body: Roboto (various weights)
- Define and save text presets for:
  - H1: Poppins Bold, 42px (desktop)/32px (mobile)
  - H2: Poppins SemiBold, 32px (desktop)/28px (mobile)
  - H3: Poppins Medium, 24px (desktop)/20px (mobile)
  - H4: Poppins Regular, 20px (desktop)/18px (mobile)
  - Body: Roboto Regular, 16px
  - Small: Roboto Light, 14px
  - Caption: Roboto Light, 12px

### 2.2 Page Structure Enhancement

#### Homepage Enhancement
Transforming the current Wix homepage to a premium aesthetic:

**Current Issues to Address:**
- Cluttered hero section
- Inconsistent grid layouts
- Insufficient whitespace
- Competing call-to-action elements
- Technical-focused rather than lifestyle/aspirational presentation

**Enhancement Strategy:**
- Replace hero image with high-quality cinematic photo featuring a premium restoration
- Apply Navy Blue overlay to hero with minimal, impactful text in Poppins
- Restructure featured vehicles section with consistent card styling
- Use Wix's section dividers to create visual separation
- Implement alternating content blocks with brand-consistent colors
- Add subtle animations and transitions where Wix permits
- Reduce content density and increase whitespace through padding
- Create a consistent CTA strategy with Burnt Orange buttons

#### Vehicle Listing Enhancement
**Current Issues to Address:**
- Inconsistent card sizes
- Dense information presentation
- Limited filtering capabilities
- Utilitarian rather than premium feel

**Enhancement Strategy:**
- Use Wix Repeater to create consistent vehicle cards
- Standardize image aspect ratios
- Apply consistent typography and spacing
- Add hover effects where possible
- Enhance filtering options through Wix Dynamic Pages
- Create clear visual hierarchy with Poppins for vehicle names
- Implement Burnt Orange pricing display
- Configure clean background with appropriate spacing
- Add "Featured" flags for premium vehicles

#### Individual Vehicle Page Enhancement
**Current Issues to Address:**
- Technical specification-heavy presentation
- Small gallery images
- Dense content without sufficient breathing room
- Limited storytelling

**Enhancement Strategy:**
- Implement full-width hero image with vehicle name in Poppins
- Use Wix Pro Gallery for enhanced photo presentation
- Create tabbed or accordion sections for specifications
- Restructure content to prioritize vehicle story and heritage
- Add before/after sliders where available
- Implement premium inquiry form with brand-consistent styling
- Create related vehicles section with consistent card styling
- Enhance mobile presentation through responsive adjustments

### 2.3 Content Refinement Strategy
- Revise copy to shift tone from technical to premium
- Update photography with consistent styling and backgrounds
- Create consistent vehicle description format focusing on:
  - Heritage and significance
  - Restoration quality
  - Adventure potential
  - Investment value
- Organize technical specifications in expandable sections
- Implement consistent call-to-action wording and placement
- Ensure typography follows brand guidelines throughout
