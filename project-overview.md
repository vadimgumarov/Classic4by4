# Classic4x4.com Wix Redesign - Project Overview

## Executive Summary
This project enhances the existing Classic4x4.com Wix website by implementing the sophisticated Retrokraft brand identity and elevating the site's visual presentation to appeal to high-end classic 4x4 collectors and enthusiasts. Taking inspiration from ClassicCarStudio.com's premium aesthetic, we will transform the current site through strategic customization of the existing Wix template.

## Business Objectives
1. Elevate brand perception to match the premium quality of our restoration work
2. Improve customer engagement with high-net-worth collectors and enthusiasts
3. Increase average vehicle sale price through enhanced presentation
4. Strengthen market positioning as a premier classic 4x4 restoration specialist
5. Improve conversion rates from website visits to inquiries

## Target Audience
Our redesigned site will better appeal to our core audience:
- Wealthy, middle-aged automotive enthusiasts (45-65 years old)
- Classic 4x4 collectors and investors
- Vintage Land Rover, Toyota Land Cruiser, and Jeep enthusiasts
- Expedition and overland travel enthusiasts
- Off-road capability-focused buyers seeking premium restorations
- Restoration clients with $75,000+ budgets

## Scope & Approach

2. Restructuring page layouts for premium presentation
3. Standardizing vehicle listings with consistent, sophisticated styling

This focused approach allows us to achieve significant improvements within a 5-week timeline while maintaining all existing content and SEO benefits.
