> Mechanical systems underwent complete renewal with our signature approach: preserving originality where it enhances character while implementing thoughtful upgrades where modern engineering provides tangible benefits. The original 2F engine was rebuilt to factory specifications with upgraded cooling and fuel delivery systems, while the drivetrain received our proprietary reliability package ensuring decades of trouble-free operation."

The recirculating ball steering system has been precisely rebuilt to eliminate excessive play while maintaining the tactile feedback that enthusiasts appreciate.
